DISCLAIMER: The information used in this code was altered by certain percentages, in addition to using only an extract of the total data. These two considerations were made because the data is confidential information from the Mining Company that provided it.

This code is a brief sample (for intellectual property reasons) of the work I carried out at S&S Solutions and Engineering, a company dedicated to the maintenance of mineral processing plants.

This dataset uses information collected by the personnel in charge of maintaining the pumps in the milling area. Specifically, it pertains to a pump that supplies clean water to the mill system.

The main objective of the code was to generate a predictive model to estimate the probability of pump failure within the next 4 hours. Two powerful classification algorithms, RandomForest and XGBoost, were used in this model. Additionally, a correlation matrix was plotted to identify the variables that have the greatest impact on the probability of pump failure.
